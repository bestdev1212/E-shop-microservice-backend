This is a cloud-first microservices NFT shop application.
Online NFT shop consists of an 11-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based NFT e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

## Quickstart (GKE)

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://Nftsale_cash_delivery&cloudshell_workspace=.&cloudshell_tutorial=docs/cloudshell-tutorial.md)

1. **[Create a Google Cloud Platform project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project)** or use an existing project. Set the `PROJECT_ID` environment variable and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud Operations APIs are enabled.

```
PROJECT_ID="<your-project-id>"
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com --project ${PROJECT_ID}
```

2. **Clone this repository.**

```
git clone https://Nftsale_cash_delivery.git
cd microservices-demo
```

3. **Create a GKE cluster.**

- GKE autopilot mode (see [Autopilot
overview](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview)
to learn more):

```
REGION=us-central1
gcloud container clusters create-auto onlineshop \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} --region=${REGION}
```

- GKE Standard mode:

```
ZONE=us-central1-b
gcloud container clusters create onlineshop \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} --zone=${ZONE} \
    --machine-type=e2-standard-2 --num-nodes=4
```

4. **Deploy the sample app to the cluster.**

```
kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```

5. **Wait for the Pods to be ready.**

```
kubectl get pods
```

After a few minutes, you should see:

```
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
adservice-76bdd69666-ckc5j               1/1     Running   0          2m58s

redis-cart-5f59546cdd-5jnqf              1/1     Running   0          2m58s
shippingservice-6ccc89f8fd-v686r         1/1     Running   0          2m58s
```

7. **Access the web frontend in a browser** using the frontend's `EXTERNAL_IP`.

```
kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
```

*Example output - do not copy*

```
EXTERNAL-IP
<your-ip>
```

**Note**- you may see `<pending>` while GCP provisions the load balancer. If this happens, wait a few minutes and re-run the command.

8. [Optional] **Clean up**:

```
gcloud container clusters delete onlineshop \
    --project=${PROJECT_ID} --zone=${ZONE}
```

## Use Terraform to provision a GKE cluster and deploy Online Shop

The [`/terraform` folder](terraform) contains instructions for using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro) to replicate the steps from [**Quickstart (GKE)**](#quickstart-gke) above.

## Other deployment variations

- **Istio**: [See these instructions.](docs/service-mesh.md)
- **Anthos Service Mesh**: [See these instructions](/docs/service-mesh.md)
- **non-GKE clusters (Minikube, Kind)**: see the [Development Guide](/docs/development-guide.md)

## Deploy Online Shop variations with Kustomize

The [`/kustomize` folder](kustomize) contains instructions for customizing the deployment of Online Shop with different variations such as:
* integrating with [Google Cloud Operations](kustomize/components/google-cloud-operations/)
* replacing the in-cluster Redis cache with [Google Cloud Memorystore (Redis)](kustomize/components/memorystore) or [Google Cloud Spanner](kustomize/components/spanner)
* etc.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[Cloud Operations (Stackdriver)](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling**, **Tracing** and **Debugging**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.
